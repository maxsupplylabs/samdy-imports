# Hi, I want give you an overview of the new interface we have for your inventory. 
# It's a whole new experience that's super intuitive and easy to use.

# Remember your store is a space with divisions, we call these divisions departments
# You might have seen something similar elsewhere, they sometimes call them "categories"

# Picture this: each department is like a special section in your store, kind of like aisles in a supermarket, 
# where you'll find collections of similar items or products.

# Right now, we've got a total of 13 departments, 
# ranging from "Bags & Luggage" all the way to "Electronics".

# Now, here's the cool part: within each department, you'll find collections tailored to specific needs. 
# We've already set up some sample collections for this demo.

# Take, for example, the "Women Bags & Luggage" department. 
# It's got two fabulous collections: "Handbags for Daily" and "Shopping Bags". Perfect for every fashion person on the go!

# But what exactly is a collection, you may ask? Well, think of it as a curated selection of products, that have something in common.

# It could be how they're used, how they function, or even just how they look. 
# For instance, the "Shopping Bags" collection in "Women Bags & Luggage" department is all about those chic totes perfect for a day out in town.

# Now: your customers are going to love exploring your store, but they need to find their way around easily. 
# That's where you come in! By creating intuitive collections, you're making it a breeze for them to find exactly what they're looking for.


# In our next video, I'll show you just how easy it is to create these collections for all your departments. Stay tuned! âœ¨
